Practice reading and describing programs

### Before Break

Describing Programs

  **[../describing-programs](../describing-programs)** and discuss how you can
  make sense of code you don't understand yet
- **In Small Groups**: practice describing programs

### After Break

Naming Variables

- **All together**: read through **[../naming-variables](../naming-variables)**
  and discuss why variable names are important
- **In Small Groups**: practice giving variables _generic_ and _specific_ names

No project. Just lots of study time, alone and in groups. Keep asking questions!
