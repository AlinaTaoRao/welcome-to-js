# Class 1

Practice using different techniques to trace a program's execution.

## Before Break

Learn these different techniques for tracing a program's execution:

- trace tables + the "trace" button
  ([tracing guide](../just-enough-javascript/guide-tracing.mp4))
- the `?highlight` lens
- the `?variables` lens
- JS Tutor (_for not-interactive code_)
- üêî your browser's debugger, helpful but also more complicated. It's not
  required in this module but is worth trying

## After Break

Practice these skills by tracing interactive Input/Output loops.
