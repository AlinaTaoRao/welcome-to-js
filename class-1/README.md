# Class 1

Practice using different techniques to trace a program's execution.

## Before Break

- Read through the different types of exercises in
  [./just-enough-javascript](./just-enough-javascript), then practice one or two
  of each from the _Variables_ chapter.
- After you've tried a bit of each exercise in _Variables_, continue practicing
  different techniques for tracing a program's execution with the exercises in [./before-break](./before-br):
  - trace tables + the "trace" button
    ([tracing guide](../just-enough-javascript/guide-tracing.mp4))
  - the `?highlight` lens
  - the `?variables` lens
  - JS Tutor (_for not-interactive code_)
  - üêî your browser's debugger, helpful but also more complicated. It's not
    required in this module but is worth trying

## After Break

Practice these skills by tracing interactive Input/Output loops.
